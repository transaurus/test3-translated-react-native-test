Animations are very important to create a great user experience. Stationary objects must overcome inertia as they start moving. Objects in motion have momentum and rarely come to a stop immediately. Animations allow you to convey physically believable motion in your interface.

React Native provides two complementary animation systems: [`Animated`](animations#animated-api) for granular and interactive control of specific values, and [`LayoutAnimation`](animations#layoutanimation-api) for animated global layout transactions.

## `Animated` API

The [`Animated`](animated) API is designed to concisely express a wide variety of interesting animation and interaction patterns in a very performant way. `Animated` focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between, and `start`/`stop` methods to control time-based animation execution.

`Animated` exports six animatable component types: `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `ScrollView`, `FlatList` and `SectionList`, but you can also create your own using `Animated.createAnimatedComponent()`.

For example, a container view that fades in when it is mounted may look like this:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString defaultValue={constants.defaultSnackLanguage} values={constants.snackLanguages}>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```SnackPlayer ext=js&supportedPlatforms=ios,android
import React, {useEffect} from 'react';
import {Animated, Text, View, useAnimatedValue} from 'react-native';

const FadeInView = props => {
  const fadeAnim = useAnimatedValue(0); // Initial value for opacity: 0

  useEffect(() => {
    Animated.timing(fadeAnim, {
      toValue: 1,
      duration: 10000,
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }).start();
  }, [fadeAnim]);

  return (
    <Animated.View // Special animatable View
      style={{
        ...props.style,
        opacity: fadeAnim, // Bind opacity to animated value
      }}>
      {props.children}
    </Animated.View>
  );
};

// You can then use your `FadeInView` in place of a `View` in your components:
export default () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      }}>
      <FadeInView
        style={{
          width: 250,
          height: 50,
          backgroundColor: 'powderblue',
        }}>
        <Text style={{fontSize: 28, textAlign: 'center', margin: 10}}>
          Fading in
        </Text>
      </FadeInView>
    </View>
  );
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

```SnackPlayer ext=tsx
import React, {useEffect} from 'react';
import {Animated, Text, View, useAnimatedValue} from 'react-native';
import type {PropsWithChildren} from 'react';
import type {ViewStyle} from 'react-native';

type FadeInViewProps = PropsWithChildren<{style: ViewStyle}>;

const FadeInView: React.FC<FadeInViewProps> = props => {
  const fadeAnim = useAnimatedValue(0); // Initial value for opacity: 0

  useEffect(() => {
    Animated.timing(fadeAnim, {
      toValue: 1,
      duration: 10000,
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }).start();
  }, [fadeAnim]);

  return (
    <Animated.View // Special animatable View
      style={{
        ...props.style,
        opacity: fadeAnim, // Bind opacity to animated value
      }}>
      {props.children}
    </Animated.View>
  );
};

// You can then use your `FadeInView` in place of a `View` in your components:
export default () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      }}>
      <FadeInView
        style={{
          width: 250,
          height: 50,
          backgroundColor: 'powderblue',
        }}>
        <Text style={{fontSize: 28, textAlign: 'center', margin: 10}}>
          Fading in
        </Text>
      </FadeInView>
    </View>
  );
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's break down what's happening here. In the `FadeInView` render method, a new `Animated.Value` called `fadeAnim` is initialized with `useRef`. The opacity property on the `View` is mapped to this animated value. Behind the scenes, the numeric value is extracted and used to set opacity.

When the component mounts, the opacity is set to 0. Then, an easing animation is started on the `fadeAnim` animated value, which will update all of its dependent mappings (in this case, only the opacity) on each frame as the value animates to the final value of 1.

This is done in an optimized way that is faster than calling `setState` and re-rendering. Because the entire configuration is declarative, we will be able to implement further optimizations that serialize the configuration and runs the animation on a high-priority thread.

### Configuring animations

Animations are heavily configurable. Custom and predefined easing functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.

`Animated` provides several animation types, the most commonly used one being [`Animated.timing()`](animated#timing). It supports animating a value over time using one of various predefined easing functions, or you can use your own. Easing functions are typically used in animation to convey gradual acceleration and deceleration of objects.

By default, `timing` will use an easeInOut curve that conveys gradual acceleration to full speed and concludes by gradually decelerating to a stop. You can specify a different easing function by passing an `easing` parameter. Custom `duration` or even a `delay` before the animation starts is also supported.

For example, if we want to create a 2-second long animation of an object that slightly backs up before moving to its final position:

```tsx
Animated.timing(this.state.xPosition, {
  toValue: 100,
  easing: Easing.back(),
  duration: 2000,
  useNativeDriver: true,
}).start();
```

Take a look at the [Configuring animations](animated#configuring-animations) section of the `Animated` API reference to learn more about all the config parameters supported by the built-in animations.

### Composing animations

Animations can be combined and played in sequence or in parallel. Sequential animations can play immediately after the previous animation has finished, or they can start after a specified delay. The `Animated` API provides several methods, such as `sequence()` and `delay()`, each of which take an array of animations to execute and automatically calls `start()`/`stop()` as needed.

For example, the following animation coasts to a stop, then it springs back while twirling in parallel:

```tsx
Animated.sequence([
  // decay, then spring to start and twirl
  Animated.decay(position, {
    // coast to a stop
    velocity: {x: gestureState.vx, y: gestureState.vy}, // velocity from gesture release
    deceleration: 0.997,
    useNativeDriver: true,
  }),
  Animated.parallel([
    // after decay, in parallel:
    Animated.spring(position, {
      toValue: {x: 0, y: 0}, // return to start
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }),
    Animated.timing(twirl, {
      // and twirl
      toValue: 360,
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }),
  ]),
]).start(); // start the sequence group
```

If one animation is stopped or interrupted, then all other animations in the group are also stopped. `Animated.parallel` has a `stopTogether` option that can be set to `false` to disable this.

You can find a full list of composition methods in the [Composing animations](animated#composing-animations) section of the `Animated` API reference.

### Combining animated values

You can [combine two animated values](animated#combining-animated-values) via addition, multiplication, division, or modulo to make a new animated value.

There are some cases where an animated value needs to invert another animated value for calculation. An example is inverting a scale (2x --> 0.5x):

```tsx
const a = new Animated.Value(1);
const b = Animated.divide(1, a);

Animated.spring(a, {
  toValue: 2,
  useNativeDriver: true,
}).start();
```

### Interpolation

Each property can be run through an interpolation first. An interpolation maps input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but also supports easing functions. By default, it will extrapolate the curve beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.

A basic mapping to convert a 0-1 range to a 0-100 range would be:

```tsx
value.interpolate({
  inputRange: [0, 1],
  outputRange: [0, 100],
});
```

For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to 1. This can be done by modifying `style` from the example above like so:

```tsx
  style={{
    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly
    transform: [{
      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({
        inputRange: [0, 1],
        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0
      }),
    }],
  }}
```

[`interpolate()`](animated#interpolate) supports multiple range segments as well, which is handy for defining dead zones and other handy tricks. For example, to get a negation relationship at -300 that goes to 0 at -100, then back up to 1 at 0, and then back down to zero at 100 followed by a dead-zone that remains at 0 for everything beyond that, you could do:

```tsx
value.interpolate({
  inputRange: [-300, -100, 0, 100, 101],
  outputRange: [300, 0, 1, 0, 0],
});
```

Which would map like so:

```
Input | Output
------|-------
  -400|    450
  -300|    300
  -200|    150
  -100|      0
   -50|    0.5
     0|      1
    50|    0.5
   100|      0
   101|      0
   200|      0
```

`interpolate()` also supports mapping to strings, allowing you to animate colors as well as values with units. For example, if you wanted to animate a rotation you could do:

```tsx
value.interpolate({
  inputRange: [0, 360],
  outputRange: ['0deg', '360deg'],
});
```

`interpolate()` also supports arbitrary easing functions, many of which are already implemented in the [`Easing`](easing) module. `interpolate()` also has configurable behavior for extrapolating the `outputRange`. You can set the extrapolation by setting the `extrapolate`, `extrapolateLeft`, or `extrapolateRight` options. The default value is `extend` but you can use `clamp` to prevent the output value from exceeding `outputRange`.

### Tracking dynamic values

Animated values can also track other values by setting the `toValue` of an animation to another animated value instead of a plain number. For example, a "Chat Heads" animation like the one used by Messenger on Android could be implemented with a `spring()` pinned on another animated value, or with `timing()` and a `duration` of 0 for rigid tracking. They can also be composed with interpolations:

```tsx
Animated.spring(follower, {toValue: leader}).start();
Animated.timing(opacity, {
  toValue: pan.x.interpolate({
    inputRange: [0, 300],
    outputRange: [1, 0],
  }),
  useNativeDriver: true,
}).start();
```

The `leader` and `follower` animated values would be implemented using `Animated.ValueXY()`. `ValueXY` is a handy way to deal with 2D interactions, such as panning or dragging. It is a basic wrapper that contains two `Animated.Value` instances and some helper functions that call through to them, making `ValueXY` a drop-in replacement for `Value` in many cases. It allows us to track both x and y values in the example above.

### Tracking gestures

Gestures, like panning or scrolling, and other events can map directly to animated values using [`Animated.event`](animated#event). This is done with a structured map syntax so that values can be extracted from complex event objects. The first level is an array to allow mapping across multiple args, and that array contains nested objects.

For example, when working with horizontal scrolling gestures, you would do the following in order to map `event.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x` to `scrollX` (an `Animated.Value`):

```tsx
 onScroll={Animated.event(
   // scrollX = e.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x
   [{nativeEvent: {
        contentOffset: {
          x: scrollX
        }
      }
    }]
 )}
```

The following example implements a horizontal scrolling carousel where the scroll position indicators are animated using the `Animated.event` used in the `ScrollView`

#### ScrollView with Animated Event Example

```SnackPlayer name=Animated&supportedPlatforms=ios,android
import React from 'react';
import {
  ScrollView,
  Text,
  StyleSheet,
  View,
  ImageBackground,
  Animated,
  useWindowDimensions,
  useAnimatedValue,
} from 'react-native';
import {SafeAreaView, SafeAreaProvider} from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

const images = new Array(6).fill(
  'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556740749-887f6717d7e4',
);

const App = () => {
  const scrollX = useAnimatedValue(0);

  const {width: windowWidth} = useWindowDimensions();

  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
        <View style={styles.scrollContainer}>
          <ScrollView
            horizontal={true}
            pagingEnabled
            showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
            onScroll={Animated.event([
              {
                nativeEvent: {
                  contentOffset: {
                    x: scrollX,
                  },
                },
              },
            ])}
            scrollEventThrottle={1}>
            {images.map((image, imageIndex) => {
              return (
                <View
                  style={{width: windowWidth, height: 250}}
                  key={imageIndex}>
                  <ImageBackground source={{uri: image}} style={styles.card}>
                    <View style={styles.textContainer}>
                      <Text style={styles.infoText}>
                        {'Image - ' + imageIndex}
                      </Text>
                    </View>
                  </ImageBackground>
                </View>
              );
            })}
          </ScrollView>
          <View style={styles.indicatorContainer}>
            {images.map((image, imageIndex) => {
              const width = scrollX.interpolate({
                inputRange: [
                  windowWidth * (imageIndex - 1),
                  windowWidth * imageIndex,
                  windowWidth * (imageIndex + 1),
                ],
                outputRange: [8, 16, 8],
                extrapolate: 'clamp',
              });
              return (
                <Animated.View
                  key={imageIndex}
                  style={[styles.normalDot, {width}]}
                />
              );
            })}
          </View>
        </View>
      </SafeAreaView>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  scrollContainer: {
    height: 300,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  card: {
    flex: 1,
    marginVertical: 4,
    marginHorizontal: 16,
    borderRadius: 5,
    overflow: 'hidden',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  textContainer: {
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0,0,0, 0.7)',
    paddingHorizontal: 24,
    paddingVertical: 8,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  infoText: {
    color: 'white',
    fontSize: 16,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  normalDot: {
    height: 8,
    width: 8,
    borderRadius: 4,
    backgroundColor: 'silver',
    marginHorizontal: 4,
  },
  indicatorContainer: {
    flexDirection: 'row',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
});

export default App;
```

When using `PanResponder`, you could use the following code to extract the x and y positions from `gestureState.dx` and `gestureState.dy`. We use a `null` in the first position of the array, as we are only interested in the second argument passed to the `PanResponder` handler, which is the `gestureState`.

```tsx
onPanResponderMove={Animated.event(
  [null, // ignore the native event
  // extract dx and dy from gestureState
  // like 'pan.x = gestureState.dx, pan.y = gestureState.dy'
  {dx: pan.x, dy: pan.y}
])}
```

#### PanResponder with Animated Event Example

```SnackPlayer name=Animated
import React, {useRef} from 'react';
import {Animated, View, StyleSheet, PanResponder, Text} from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const pan = useRef(new Animated.ValueXY()).current;
  const panResponder = useRef(
    PanResponder.create({
      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: () => true,
      onPanResponderMove: Animated.event([null, {dx: pan.x, dy: pan.y}]),
      onPanResponderRelease: () => {
        Animated.spring(pan, {
          toValue: {x: 0, y: 0},
          useNativeDriver: true,
        }).start();
      },
    }),
  ).current;

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.titleText}>Drag & Release this box!</Text>
      <Animated.View
        style={{
          transform: [{translateX: pan.x}, {translateY: pan.y}],
        }}
        {...panResponder.panHandlers}>
        <View style={styles.box} />
      </Animated.View>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  titleText: {
    fontSize: 14,
    lineHeight: 24,
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  box: {
    height: 150,
    width: 150,
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
});

export default App;
```

### Responding to the current animation value

You may notice that there is no clear way to read the current value while animating. This is because the value may only be known in the native runtime due to optimizations. If you need to run JavaScript in response to the current value, there are two approaches:

- `spring.stopAnimation(callback)` will stop the animation and invoke `callback` with the final value. This is useful when making gesture transitions.
- `spring.addListener(callback)` will invoke `callback` asynchronously while the animation is running, providing a recent value. This is useful for triggering state changes, for example snapping a bobble to a new option as the user drags it closer, because these larger state changes are less sensitive to a few frames of lag compared to continuous gestures like panning which need to run at 60 fps.

`Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system. Check out `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance implications in the future.

### Using the native driver

The `Animated` API is designed to be serializable. By using the [native driver](/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated), we send everything about the animation to native before starting the animation, allowing native code to perform the animation on the UI thread without having to go through the bridge on every frame. Once the animation has started, the JS thread can be blocked without affecting the animation.

Using the native driver for normal animations can be accomplished by setting `useNativeDriver: true` in animation config when starting it. Animations without a `useNativeDriver` property will default to false for legacy reasons, but emit a warning (and typechecking error in TypeScript).

```tsx
Animated.timing(this.state.animatedValue, {
  toValue: 1,
  duration: 500,
  useNativeDriver: true, // <-- Set this to true
}).start();
```

Animated values are only compatible with one driver so if you use native driver when starting an animation on a value, make sure every animation on that value also uses the native driver.

The native driver also works with `Animated.event`. This is especially useful for animations that follow the scroll position as without the native driver, the animation will always run a frame behind the gesture due to the async nature of React Native.

```tsx
<Animated.ScrollView // <-- Use the Animated ScrollView wrapper
  onScroll={Animated.event(
    [
      {
        nativeEvent: {
          contentOffset: {y: this.state.animatedValue},
        },
      },
    ],
    {useNativeDriver: true}, // <-- Set this to true
  )}>
  {content}
</Animated.ScrollView>
```

You can see the native driver in action by running the [RNTester app](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/rn-tester/), then loading the Native Animated Example. You can also take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/NativeAnimation/NativeAnimationsExample.js) to learn how these examples were produced.

#### Caveats

並非所有使用 `Animated` 的功能目前都受到原生驅動程式的支援。主要的限制在於你只能動畫化非佈局屬性：像是 `transform` 和 `opacity` 這類屬性可以運作，但 Flexbox 和位置屬性則不行。當使用 `Animated.event` 時，它僅適用於直接事件而不支援冒泡事件。這意味著它無法與 `PanResponder` 一起使用，但可以與 `ScrollView#onScroll` 這類功能協同工作。

當動畫正在執行時，它可能會阻止 `VirtualizedList` 元件渲染更多行。如果你需要在用戶滾動列表時執行長時間或循環動畫，可以在動畫配置中使用 `isInteraction: false` 來避免這個問題。

### 注意事項

使用如 `rotateY`、`rotateX` 等變形樣式時，請確保同時設置 `perspective` 變形樣式。目前某些動畫若缺少此設定，在 Android 上可能無法正常渲染。以下為範例。

```tsx
<Animated.View
  style={{
    transform: [
      {scale: this.state.scale},
      {rotateY: this.state.rotateY},
      {perspective: 1000}, // without this line this Animation will not render on Android while working fine on iOS
    ],
  }}
/>
```

### 其他範例

RNTester 應用程式內含多種使用 `Animated` 的範例：

- [AnimatedGratuitousApp](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/AnimatedGratuitousApp)
- [NativeAnimationsExample](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/NativeAnimation/NativeAnimationsExample.js)

## `LayoutAnimation` API

`LayoutAnimation` 允許你全局配置將在下個渲染/佈局週期中用於所有視圖的「創建」和「更新」動畫。這對於進行 Flexbox 佈局更新非常有用，無需費心測量或計算特定屬性來直接動畫化它們，特別適用於佈局變更可能影響上層元素的情況，例如「查看更多」展開同時增加父容器尺寸並下推下方列，這通常需要元件間明確協調才能同步動畫化所有元素。

請注意，儘管 `LayoutAnimation` 功能強大且相當實用，但它提供的控制力遠低於 `Animated` 和其他動畫函式庫，因此若無法透過 `LayoutAnimation` 達成需求，可能需要改用其他方法。

請注意，在 **Android** 上要使此功能正常運作，需透過 `UIManager` 設置以下標記：

```tsx
UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true);
```

```SnackPlayer name=LayoutAnimations&supportedPlatforms=ios,android
import React from 'react';
import {
  NativeModules,
  LayoutAnimation,
  Text,
  TouchableOpacity,
  StyleSheet,
  View,
} from 'react-native';

const {UIManager} = NativeModules;

UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental &&
  UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true);

export default class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    w: 100,
    h: 100,
  };

  _onPress = () => {
    // Animate the update
    LayoutAnimation.spring();
    this.setState({w: this.state.w + 15, h: this.state.h + 15});
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <View
          style={[styles.box, {width: this.state.w, height: this.state.h}]}
        />
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._onPress}>
          <View style={styles.button}>
            <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Press me!</Text>
          </View>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    backgroundColor: 'red',
  },
  button: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    paddingHorizontal: 20,
    paddingVertical: 15,
    marginTop: 15,
  },
  buttonText: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

此範例使用預設值，你可以根據需求自訂動畫，詳見 [LayoutAnimation.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/react-native/Libraries/LayoutAnimation/LayoutAnimation.js) 以獲取更多資訊。

## 補充說明

### `requestAnimationFrame`

`requestAnimationFrame` 是來自瀏覽器的 polyfill，你可能對它很熟悉。它接受一個函式作為唯一參數，並在下一次重繪前調用該函式。這是所有基於 JavaScript 的動畫 API 的基礎建構模組。通常你不需要自行調用它——動畫 API 會為你管理影格更新。

### `setNativeProps`

如[直接操作章節](legacy/direct-manipulation)所述，`setNativeProps` 允許我們直接修改原生支援元件（實際由原生視圖支援的元件，而非複合元件）的屬性，而無需透過 `setState` 和重新渲染元件層級結構。

我們可以在 Rebound 範例中使用此方法來更新縮放比例——這對於更新深度嵌套且未經 `shouldComponentUpdate` 優化的元件可能特別有用。

If you find your animations with dropping frames (performing below 60 frames per second), look into using `setNativeProps` or `shouldComponentUpdate` to optimize them. Or you could run the animations on the UI thread rather than the JavaScript thread [with the useNativeDriver option](/blog/2017/02/14/using-native-driver-for-animated). You may also want to defer any computationally intensive work until after animations are complete, using the [InteractionManager](interactionmanager). You can monitor the frame rate by using the In-App Dev Menu "FPS Monitor" tool.
