The `Animated` library is designed to make animations fluid, powerful, and painless to build and maintain. `Animated` focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, configurable transforms in between, and `start`/`stop` methods to control time-based animation execution.

The core workflow for creating an animation is to create an `Animated.Value`, hook it up to one or more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates via animations using `Animated.timing()`.

> Don't modify the animated value directly. You can use the [`useRef` Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref) to return a mutable ref object. This ref object's `current` property is initialized as the given argument and persists throughout the component lifecycle.

## Example

The following example contains a `View` which will fade in and fade out based on the animated value `fadeAnim`

```SnackPlayer name=Animated&supportedPlatforms=ios,android
import React from 'react';
import {
  Animated,
  Text,
  View,
  StyleSheet,
  Button,
  SafeAreaView,
  useAnimatedValue,
} from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  // fadeAnim will be used as the value for opacity. Initial Value: 0
  const fadeAnim = useAnimatedValue(0);

  const fadeIn = () => {
    // Will change fadeAnim value to 1 in 5 seconds
    Animated.timing(fadeAnim, {
      toValue: 1,
      duration: 5000,
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }).start();
  };

  const fadeOut = () => {
    // Will change fadeAnim value to 0 in 3 seconds
    Animated.timing(fadeAnim, {
      toValue: 0,
      duration: 3000,
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }).start();
  };

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <Animated.View
        style={[
          styles.fadingContainer,
          {
            // Bind opacity to animated value
            opacity: fadeAnim,
          },
        ]}>
        <Text style={styles.fadingText}>Fading View!</Text>
      </Animated.View>
      <View style={styles.buttonRow}>
        <Button title="Fade In View" onPress={fadeIn} />
        <Button title="Fade Out View" onPress={fadeOut} />
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  fadingContainer: {
    padding: 20,
    backgroundColor: 'powderblue',
  },
  fadingText: {
    fontSize: 28,
  },
  buttonRow: {
    flexBasis: 100,
    justifyContent: 'space-evenly',
    marginVertical: 16,
  },
});

export default App;
```

Refer to the [Animations](animations#animated-api) guide to see additional examples of `Animated` in action.

## Overview

There are two value types you can use with `Animated`:

- [`Animated.Value()`](animated#value) for single values
- [`Animated.ValueXY()`](animated#valuexy) for vectors

`Animated.Value` can bind to style properties or other props, and can be interpolated as well. A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties.

### Configuring animations

`Animated` provides three types of animation types. Each animation type provides a particular animation curve that controls how your values animate from their initial value to the final value:

- [`Animated.decay()`](animated#decay) starts with an initial velocity and gradually slows to a stop.
- [`Animated.spring()`](animated#spring) provides a basic spring physics model.
- [`Animated.timing()`](animated#timing) animates a value over time using [easing functions](easing).

In most cases, you will be using `timing()`. By default, it uses a symmetric easeInOut curve that conveys the gradual acceleration of an object to full speed and concludes by gradually decelerating to a stop.

### Working with animations

Animations are started by calling `start()` on your animation. `start()` takes a completion callback that will be called when the animation is done. If the animation finished running normally, the completion callback will be invoked with `{finished: true}`. If the animation is done because `stop()` was called on it before it could finish (e.g. because it was interrupted by a gesture or another animation), then it will receive `{finished: false}`.

```tsx
Animated.timing({}).start(({finished}) => {
  /* completion callback */
});
```

### Using the native driver

By using the native driver, we send everything about the animation to native before starting the animation, allowing native code to perform the animation on the UI thread without having to go through the bridge on every frame. Once the animation has started, the JS thread can be blocked without affecting the animation.

You can use the native driver by specifying `useNativeDriver: true` in your animation configuration. See the [Animations](animations#using-the-native-driver) guide to learn more.

### Animatable components

Only animatable components can be animated. These unique components do the magic of binding the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to avoid the cost of the React render and reconciliation process on every frame. They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.

- [`createAnimatedComponent()`](animated#createanimatedcomponent) can be used to make a component animatable.

`Animated` exports the following animatable components using the above wrapper:

- `Animated.Image`
- `Animated.ScrollView`
- `Animated.Text`
- `Animated.View`
- `Animated.FlatList`
- `Animated.SectionList`

### Composing animations

Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions:

- [`Animated.delay()`](animated#delay) starts an animation after a given delay.
- [`Animated.parallel()`](animated#parallel) starts a number of animations at the same time.
- [`Animated.sequence()`](animated#sequence) starts the animations in order, waiting for each to complete before starting the next.
- [`Animated.stagger()`](animated#stagger) starts animations in order and in parallel, but with successive delays.

Animations can also be chained together by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`. See [Tracking dynamic values](animations#tracking-dynamic-values) in the Animations guide.

By default, if one animation is stopped or interrupted, then all other animations in the group are also stopped.

### Combining animated values

You can combine two animated values via addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or modulo to make a new animated value:

- [`Animated.add()`](animated#add)
- [`Animated.subtract()`](animated#subtract)
- [`Animated.divide()`](animated#divide)
- [`Animated.modulo()`](animated#modulo)
- [`Animated.multiply()`](animated#multiply)

### Interpolation

The `interpolate()` function allows input ranges to map to different output ranges. By default, it will extrapolate the curve beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value. It uses linear interpolation by default but also supports easing functions.

- [`interpolate()`](animated#interpolate)

Read more about interpolation in the [Animation](animations#interpolation) guide.

### Handling gestures and other events

Gestures, like panning or scrolling, and other events can map directly to animated values using `Animated.event()`. This is done with a structured map syntax so that values can be extracted from complex event objects. The first level is an array to allow mapping across multiple args, and that array contains nested objects.

- [`Animated.event()`](animated#event)

For example, when working with horizontal scrolling gestures, you would do the following in order to map `event.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x` to `scrollX` (an `Animated.Value`):

```tsx
 onScroll={Animated.event(
   // scrollX = e.nativeEvent.contentOffset.x
   [{nativeEvent: {
        contentOffset: {
          x: scrollX
        }
      }
    }]
 )}
```

# Reference

## Methods

When the given value is a ValueXY instead of a Value, each config option may be a vector of the form `{x: ..., y: ...}` instead of a scalar.

### `decay()`

```tsx
static decay(value, config): CompositeAnimation;
```

Animates a value from an initial velocity to zero based on a decay coefficient.

Config is an object that may have the following options:

- `velocity`: Initial velocity. Required.
- `deceleration`: Rate of decay. Default 0.997.
- `isInteraction`: Whether or not this animation creates an "interaction handle" on the `InteractionManager`. Default true.
- `useNativeDriver`: Uses the native driver when true. Required.

---

### `timing()`

```tsx
static timing(value, config): CompositeAnimation;
```

Animates a value along a timed easing curve. The [`Easing`](easing) module has tons of predefined curves, or you can use your own function.

Config is an object that may have the following options:

- `duration`: Length of animation (milliseconds). Default 500.
- `easing`: Easing function to define curve. Default is `Easing.inOut(Easing.ease)`.
- `delay`: Start the animation after delay (milliseconds). Default 0.
- `isInteraction`: Whether or not this animation creates an "interaction handle" on the `InteractionManager`. Default true.
- `useNativeDriver`: Uses the native driver when true. Required.

---

### `spring()`

```tsx
static spring(value, config): CompositeAnimation;
```

根據[阻尼諧振子](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator#Damped_harmonic_oscillator)的解析彈簧模型動畫化數值。該方法會追蹤速度狀態以在`toValue`更新時創建流暢運動，並可被串聯使用。

配置為一個物件，可包含以下選項。

注意：您只能定義以下其中一組參數，不可混用：

friction/tension或bounciness/speed選項與[Facebook Pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop)、[Rebound](https://github.com/facebookarchive/rebound)及[Origami](https://origami.design/)中的彈簧模型相匹配。

- `friction`: 控制「彈性」/過衝。預設值7。
- `tension`: 控制速度。預設值40。
- `speed`: 控制動畫速度。預設值12。
- `bounciness`: 控制彈性。預設值8。

指定stiffness/damping/mass參數會使`Animated.spring`採用基於[阻尼諧振子運動方程](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator#Damped_harmonic_oscillator)的解析彈簧模型。此行為更精確且符合彈簧動力學的物理原理，並高度模擬iOS中CASpringAnimation的實現。

- `stiffness`: 彈簧剛度係數。預設值100。
- `damping`: 定義彈簧運動應如何因摩擦力而衰減。預設值10。
- `mass`: 附著於彈簧末端的物體質量。預設值1。

其他配置選項如下：

- `velocity`: 附著於彈簧的物體初始速度。預設0（物體靜止）。
- `overshootClamping`: 布林值，指示彈簧是否應箝位且不彈跳。預設false。
- `restDisplacementThreshold`: 靜止位移閾值，低於此值彈簧視為靜止。預設0.001。
- `restSpeedThreshold`: 彈簧視為靜止的速度閾值（像素/秒）。預設0.001。
- `delay`: 延遲啟動動畫（毫秒）。預設0。
- `isInteraction`: 是否在`InteractionManager`上創建「交互句柄」。預設true。
- `useNativeDriver`: 為true時使用原生驅動。必填。

### `add()`

```tsx
static add(a: Animated, b: Animated): AnimatedAddition;
```

創建由兩個Animated值相加組成的新Animated值。

---

### `subtract()`

```tsx
static subtract(a: Animated, b: Animated): AnimatedSubtraction;
```

創建由第一個Animated值減去第二個Animated值組成的新Animated值。

---

### `divide()`

```tsx
static divide(a: Animated, b: Animated): AnimatedDivision;
```

創建由第一個Animated值除以第二個Animated值組成的新Animated值。

---

### `multiply()`

```tsx
static multiply(a: Animated, b: Animated): AnimatedMultiplication;
```

創建由兩個Animated值相乘組成的新Animated值。

---

### `modulo()`

```tsx
static modulo(a: Animated, modulus: number): AnimatedModulo;
```

創建提供Animated值的（非負）模數新Animated值。

---

### `diffClamp()`

```tsx
static diffClamp(a: Animated, min: number, max: number): AnimatedDiffClamp;
```

Create a new Animated value that is limited between 2 values. It uses the difference between the last value so even if the value is far from the bounds it will start changing when the value starts getting closer again. (`value = clamp(value + diff, min, max)`).

This is useful with scroll events, for example, to show the navbar when scrolling up and to hide it when scrolling down.

---

### `delay()`

```tsx
static delay(time: number): CompositeAnimation;
```

Starts an animation after the given delay.

---

### `sequence()`

```tsx
static sequence(animations: CompositeAnimation[]): CompositeAnimation;
```

Starts an array of animations in order, waiting for each to complete before starting the next. If the current running animation is stopped, no following animations will be started.

---

### `parallel()`

```tsx
static parallel(
  animations: CompositeAnimation[],
  config?: ParallelConfig
): CompositeAnimation;
```

Starts an array of animations all at the same time. By default, if one of the animations is stopped, they will all be stopped. You can override this with the `stopTogether` flag.

---

### `stagger()`

```tsx
static stagger(
  time: number,
  animations: CompositeAnimation[]
): CompositeAnimation;
```

Array of animations may run in parallel (overlap), but are started in sequence with successive delays. Nice for doing trailing effects.

---

### `loop()`

```tsx
static loop(
  animation: CompositeAnimation[],
  config?: LoopAnimationConfig
): CompositeAnimation;
```

Loops a given animation continuously, so that each time it reaches the end, it resets and begins again from the start. Will loop without blocking the JS thread if the child animation is set to `useNativeDriver: true`. In addition, loops can prevent `VirtualizedList`-based components from rendering more rows while the animation is running. You can pass `isInteraction: false` in the child animation config to fix this.

Config is an object that may have the following options:

- `iterations`: Number of times the animation should loop. Default `-1` (infinite).

---

### `event()`

```tsx
static event(
  argMapping: Mapping[],
  config?: EventConfig
): (...args: any[]) => void;
```

Takes an array of mappings and extracts values from each arg accordingly, then calls `setValue` on the mapped outputs. e.g.

```tsx
onScroll={Animated.event(
  [{nativeEvent: {contentOffset: {x: this._scrollX}}}],
  {listener: (event: ScrollEvent) => console.log(event)}, // Optional async listener
)}
 ...
onPanResponderMove: Animated.event(
  [
    null, // raw event arg ignored
    {dx: this._panX},
  ], // gestureState arg
  {
    listener: (
      event: GestureResponderEvent,
      gestureState: PanResponderGestureState
    ) => console.log(event, gestureState),
  } // Optional async listener
);
```

Config is an object that may have the following options:

- `listener`: Optional async listener.
- `useNativeDriver`: Uses the native driver when true. Required.

---

### `forkEvent()`

```jsx
static forkEvent(event: AnimatedEvent, listener: Function): AnimatedEvent;
```

Advanced imperative API for snooping on animated events that are passed in through props. It permits to add a new javascript listener to an existing `AnimatedEvent`. If `animatedEvent` is a javascript listener, it will merge the 2 listeners into a single one, and if `animatedEvent` is null/undefined, it will assign the javascript listener directly. Use values directly where possible.

---

### `unforkEvent()`

```jsx
static unforkEvent(event: AnimatedEvent, listener: Function);
```

---

### `start()`

```tsx
static start(callback?: (result: {finished: boolean}) => void);
```

Animations are started by calling start() on your animation. start() takes a completion callback that will be called when the animation is done or when the animation is done because stop() was called on it before it could finish.

**Parameters:**

| Name     | Type                                    | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| callback | `(result: {finished: boolean}) => void` | No       | Function that will be called after the animation finished running normally or when the animation is done because stop() was called on it before it could finish |

Start example with callback:

```tsx
Animated.timing({}).start(({finished}) => {
  /* completion callback */
});
```

---

### `stop()`

```tsx
static stop();
```

停止任何正在執行的動畫。

---

### `reset()`

```tsx
static reset();
```

停止任何正在執行的動畫並將值重置為原始狀態。

## 屬性
